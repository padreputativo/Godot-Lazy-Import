# Lazy Import Plugin for Godot 3.3
Using this plugin, you will be able to try to:

- Create Godot PBR Materials automatically using their filenames...
- Create inherited Scenes from your meshes...
- Test your materials in a preconfigured Test Scene!
- Order your Assets adding order_children_nodes.gd to it is parent node!
- Add EnviromentTemplate.tscn to test your own scenes

The plugin is about 10mb only! It will appear as a Tab in the left dock.

I created this plugin because I did not like the 3D workflow and I do not understand how to configure PBR Materials properly, so if you find some kind of error or know how to improve the results, please Contribute in my GitHub! Thanks!
